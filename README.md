# YouTube Downloader

This is a YouTube Downloader built on Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, the Python is built on Flask while everything else is pretty much raw. This is a simple project of mine to try get my head around front and back-end web development. I found this to be a good project to start off with since I feel alot of youtube users will have a use for this, including me at times. This project will stay completely open source as I build it up day by day. Theres a few more things that need to be checked off in regards to mp4 downloading, sending files back to the user, and better mobile support.
